# Note 
I am pulling this puzzle from the Ted-Education youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDEducation).
They have a ton of really good videos on logic puzzles so please consider checking them out. Our group chose this Hat Puzzle specifically because we liked it and it seemed like a cool thing to share.

# Prompt 
For whatever reasons you and 9 other friends are captured by aliens. If you can solve their puzzle you get to live otherwise, all of you will die. 

Here are the conditions:

* All ten of you will be placed in a single file line, facing forward, and in descending order of height from left to right (tallest person on the left and shortest person on the right). 

* You all have hats on, these hats can either be black or white. 

* The aliens will then ask each person from left to right what color their hat is. Youâ€™re given 15 minutes to meet before this happens.

* One person is allowed to mess up one time, if more than one mess up occurs, all of you die.
