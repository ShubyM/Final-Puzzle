The solution lies within the fact that the group can make one error and what information each person in the line has.
Because they are sorted by height the first person in the line from left to right can see everyone else's hat color. So in that 15 minutes that you had before this happened you could have designated to that tallest person to count the number of let's say black hats he sees, and if he sees an odd number he says black, otherwise he says white.    

Hypothetically lets say that our tallest person said black. That means he saw an odd number of black hats. Then the next person in line looks at the hats they see. If they also see an odd number of black hats their hat must be white.  

This keeps going all the way down until the last person, if he is keeping track of who says white and who says black then by the end he can easily make the deduction about his own hat color.

Also remember that the group is allowed to make one error so even if the first person does not say the right color, it is okay.
